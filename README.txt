An experimental test suite for Drush (http://drush.ws) based on
phpunit (http://www.phpunit.de/). The intent is to commit this to core Drush.

Usage
--------
- Install PHPUnit
- From the root of this package: `phpunit .` or `runner.php .`

Notes
----------
- I have run tests within Netbeans and it works.
